  <h1>HTML</h1>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) form the building blocks of our website. The vast majority of our content on a webpage is created using HTML, to later be styled with css, and possibly controlled with js. HTML is made up of tags that tell a web browser how to display the content of the web page, for example, this part right here is contained within a &ltp&gt tag. As of HTML 5.2 there are 142 HTML tags, although only 115 tags are deemed functional. This website is a work in progress, and will start with basic html tags that are commonly used. Other tags will be added as time goes on.</p>

  <h2>Tag Format</h2>
  <p>The standard format for a tag is as follows:
  <p>&lttagname&gtContent goes here&lt/tagname&gt</p>
  <p>Notice the forward slash ( / ) before tag name in the second set of angular braces ( &lt &gt ). This is called a closing tag, and most HTML tags require both an opening and closing tag. There are examples of tags that do not require a closing tag. These tags are commonly called empty tags, void tags, or self-closing tags. Tags can also have attributes that edit how the tag behaves. When a tag possesses such an attribute it will be included in the opening tag's angular braces, for example to add controls to an audio tag we use the following tag format:</p>
  <p>&ltaudio controls&gt&ltaudio&gt</p>
  </p>
  <h2>Tags</h2>
  <p>Tags will be listed in alphabetical order. The initial tag name will also be a hyperlink to the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools</a>
